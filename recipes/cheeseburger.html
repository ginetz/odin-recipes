    <h1>Smashed Cheeseburger</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/recipes/cheeseburger.png">
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>See, by placing a ball of meat on a hot, unoiled griddle and smashing it down firmly into a flat we can make a great cheeseburger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>two buns</li>
            <li>two two-ounce patties</li>
            <li>american cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You start by placing two two-ounce patties on the surface of a hot (and I mean hot) griddle. These are relatively high-fat patties (around 25% fat), made with a combination of short rib, brisket, and sirloin.</li>
            <li>Smash the Patties.</li>
            <li>Next up, the patties get seasoned with salt and pepper. When you've got great beef, this is the only additional flavoring it needs. Think of it as a suit and tie for your patties.</li>
            <li>Flip and Add Cheese.</li>
            <li>Assemble and bring it home.</li>
        </ol>
